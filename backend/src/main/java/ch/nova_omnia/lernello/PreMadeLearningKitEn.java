        ### The main components of a throttle system are:
        - An **open throttle tank**
        - A **float**
        - An **inlet gate**
        - An **outlet gate**

        The **flow control** is the primary purpose of a throttle system, such as those offered by Abwasser Wild Armaturen AG. These systems serve the ***automatic regulation of discharges** from combined sewer systems and stormwater retention basins.

        The key aspects of flow regulation by these throttle systems include:
        - **Purpose and accuracy**: The systems are designed for the regulation of discharges with **highest flow accuracy**. The **control accuracy** is ±3.5%, and for flow rates under 35 l/s even ±1.0 l/s.
        - **Controllable flow rates**: The systems can regulate flow rates from **5 to 900 l/s**. For wastewater, a **minimum flow rate of 10 l/s** is required.
        - **Functionality and components**: The flow control is achieved through a system consisting of an **open throttle tank**, a **float**, and **inlet and outlet gates**. The float, part of the **float throttle type WSD**, plays a central role in automatic adjustment.
        - **Hydraulic design**: The sizing and hydraulic design of the throttle systems are carried out according to customer specifications to ensure optimal flow regulation. This includes specific parameters of the project.
        - **Relevant planning data**: Detailed technical data are necessary for planning and ordering, directly related to flow regulation:
            o Maximum backwater height (h max)
            o Dry weather flow (Q)
            o Target flow rate (Qab)
            o Inlet and outlet target levels
            o Diameter of inlet and outlet pipes (DN1, DN2)
